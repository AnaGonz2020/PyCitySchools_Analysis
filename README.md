# Comments and Thoughts
As scared and intimidated as I was coming in to the Pandas Module, I am happy with the experience this challenge gave me. Throughout my time working on this challenge, I rode the emotional roller coaster of 'do I know what I am doing?', 'should I continue this?'. With not just the support at home, but all the help the Instructor and TA provide and the additional support on Slack, I was able to push through it. I have been fortunate enough to have met some awesome classmates, who, without a doubt, helped me so much in completing this challenge when I hit a KeyError that stumped many a people. With the Study Group we created, I have been able to hear other's experience and how they are doing. 

I became more confortable creating dataframes within files, while working on this challenge. I had difficulty understanding some of the KeyErrors and ValueErrors that kept popping up, but with the BugFixingBonanza material from class, I became a little more familiar with debuigging and searching for the solutions to the errors that kept coming up. I definitely learned that I am in dyer need of more practice on the Syntax of things. My mind is stuck on the 'there is only one right answer' way I have been using my entire life, so rewiring that aspect has definitely had an impact on how fast I can move forward. With time and lots of studying, this will be a breeze.
